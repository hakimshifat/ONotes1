# Alcohol(-OH)
Types of Alcohol:
1. Primary
2. Secondary
3. Tertiary
Alcohols are Very Weakly Acidic and they do not react with strong bases like NaOH

## Two ways to make it


1. Commertially : Using Addition Reaction

Which is basically a addition reaction at 280 Degree and 300 Atm Presssure

2. Biologically: Fermentation of Sugar or Starch in absence of Oxygen

## Reactions: Patial and Complete Oxidation

2nd Reaction: Alcohols react with Alcohols to produce hydrogen

# Aldehydes and Ketones: ![[Pasted image 20230828132242.png]]

## Simplest Ketone: Acetone

### Alcohol to Aldehyde and Ketone is Possible

Primary Alcohol>>>Partial Oxidation>>>Aldehyde
Secondary Alcohol >>> Partial Oxidation>>>Ketone

## Aldol Condensation : Two Molecule of aldehyde unit produces a molecule of Aldol which is both Aldehyde and Alcohol

Aldehyde + Aldehyde == Aldol
