1.Nepotism, favouritism exists everywhere. So no organisation or group will ever be fair. Work your way around it.

2. Action speaks volumes, talk is cheap. Don't believe the 'talk', pay attention to what they do rather than what they say.

3. People will treat you based on how much value you provide & how useful you are, specially when you are born a MAN. We've to be useful & provide value to be treated nice at the bare minimum :))

4. Don't be out making enemies(be nice to others), rather expand your network.

5. When someone wants to leave, let em, in the most concise way, bid them goodbye & shut the door. If they wanna comeback, politely refuse.

6. When you start winning, youâ€™ll make more enemies, & a big portion of those enemies will be from your own friends
