Next slide (Introduction)

if you are going to ask me why we are talking about mental health or what’s the point… let me answer this with a story….. when all of us were little kids  and if we went up to our friends and share anything that has been bothering you mentally, they are most definitely going one of two words mental and autistic and they will keep bullying you forever for that. 
My point here is  in our society in Bangladesh we dont signify mental health  as much as we should and we are not even close to being comfortable to share about our mental issues. So in this presentation we are going to try our best to make you guys understand and also come up with a innovative solution  which  we are going to discuss in a bit…

next slide:
so these are the things we are going to be covering. To keep it simple at first we are going help you what mental health is and why is important then we are going to show you in what aspects it is affecting in our lives and their solutions with one being an app which is an interesting possible solution.

We will try our best to present all of this to you and keep as engaging  and also as informative as possible so that you can directly relate this  to yourselves.

well my groupmates already discussed about the importance of mental health and current situation of mental health disorders.from the statistics its clear that the number of people that are suffering from mental health issues are increasing day by day right? So as a computer science and engineering student, the first thing that came up to our mind was technology. Well we live in a modern age where its impossible to even think our life without technology.well i think we all have heard about the bad impacts of technology and social media in our mental health. in fact we all had to read paragraphs and essays on it during our scl days, havent we? But cant we use this technology as a positive solution as well?


so after doing some reserches, we found some significant impacts of technology .Firstly it has improved access to mental health services. since it is so easy to get access to this it has also increased patient engagement. People now can get personalized treatment according to their needs and comforts by the help of technology. One of the most significant impact of technolgy is reducing stigma. I think we all know how most of the parents doesnt give enough attention when their child is talking about their mental health struggles. They might tell you its all happening just because you are too lazy or maybe because you are not grateful to life. I think we can all relate to that right? But is it actually our parents fault? Or is it beacause they are not fimilliar with this concept? but through technology creating awareness among people has become quite easy. and thats how obiously we are getting more and more improved outcomes


now you may ask what are the ways of using technology in this field?  firstly E-therapy, which is helping us to get therapy through online. Next we got chatbots and voice assistants which is helping us to know our illness better. we have apps and websites that are so easy to access for getting immediate help. And lastly virtual activities which is helping to send the message among the mass people

  
well we all have smartphones right? And isnt it so amazing how we can get access to anything just through a single app? And thats why software developers are working on developing apps to help us improving our mental health. There can be a app about addiction recovery or meditation. Or we can learn to control stress and anxiety though an app . There are also lots of app for helping you get educated on mental disorders and help you to get proper help

since we are talking about an app, we got to mentions its possible features.
well firstly an mental health app should have a self monitoring feature and a daily progress tracker to keep a history of your improvements . It will  help your therapist to understand your situation in a better way and give you proper treatment according to your needs.an app must provide video and audio contents that will help you to understand your symptoms  and what possible problems you might have and do you need professional help or not. Then we have sessions and webinars. Its not always possible to join these sessions live since we all are busy in our lives. so an app should help you to join sessions and webinars around the world to get access to international experts through online easily. There can be a notification and reminders to help you taking medicines on time or doing meditations. In app chat and chatbot will give you an immediate guidance since you cant get access to therapist all the time. Then we have connecting with supporting groups which will help you to connect with the people around the world who are also suffering as you. everyone can share their personal experiences there and it will make you realize you are not alone and will inspire you to not give up. And lastly it will help you to find a suitable therapists according to your problem. There can be a location tracking system that will provide you details about therapists in your local area. also there can be a system to connect you with therapist through online sessions

so thats all from my side.now my next groupmate will countinue our presetation from here

In Conclusion, lets summerize the entire thing from beginning. We have seen What is mental health and why it is important. We have learned that it is as important as Physical health for a persons overall health and wellbeing. We have seen the examples and causes of mental health condition. We have also seen the most people that are affected by mental health conditions are aged 18-24 and also the most common desease is Depression and loneliness. And according to our research the reason behind it is excessive use of social media. According to WHO, by 2030 , the mental health issue will be the most spoken topic due to the sudden rise of social media and the depression it brings with.
We have also discussed the way of prevention. The most simple way of this is to JUST TALK. But nowadays we have made it a taboo and dont really want to talk about it. Thats why our solution was a simple app that is affordable for everyone and provides immediate professional support. But it also have some drawbacks.
(if there is time) I do not know how many of you are aware of the fact that yesterday 10th october was mental health day And BUP have its own Counselling and Placement center...
