if you are going to ask me why we are talking about mental health or what’s the point… let me answer this with a story….. when all of us were little kids  and if we went up to our friends and share anything that has been bothering you mentally, they are most definitely going one of two words mental and autistic and they will keep bullying you forever for that. 
My point here is  in our society in Bangladesh we dont signify mental health  as much as we should and we are not even close to being comfortable to share about our mental issues. So in this presentation we are going to try our best to make you guys understand and also come up with a innovative solution  which  we are going to discuss in a bit…

To keep it simple at first we are going help you what mental health is and why is important then we are going to show you in what aspects it is affecting in our lives and their solutions with one being an app which is an interesting possible solution.

We will try our best to present all of this to you and keep as engaging  and also as informative as possible so that you can directly relate this  to yourselves.

Thats why our solution was a simple app that is affordable for everyone and provides immediate professional support. But it also have some drawbacks t
