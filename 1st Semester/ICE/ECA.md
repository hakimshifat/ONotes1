## Main Topic : Electrical Circuit Analysis

## Sub Topic :

## Discussion:

# What is proton:
The nucleus of the hydrogen atom is the proton, a positively charged particle.
[[Atomic Structure]]

## Electrical Network

- Passive Elements : The elements which receives or absorbs energy and either converts it into heat or store it in an magnetic field 
  - Ex: Transformer
- Active Elements: Only supplies energy
  - Ex: Transistor



- Bilateral Elements: Conduction in BOTH DIRECTION. Ex: Inductor, Capacitor
- Unilateral: Allows conduction in  Only One direction. Ex: Diode, Transistor


- What is response: An application of input signal to the system that will produce an output signal, the behavior of output signal with time is known as the response of the system.

# Electrical Signal

- AC: The directing electricity flows throughout the circuit is CONSTANTLY REVERSING.
- DC: Electricity flows in one direction between power and ground. There is always a positive source of voltage and ground source(0V) of voltage


## Electrical Components 
- Capacitor: stores electricity and then discharges it into the circuit when there is a drop in electricity
- Diode: Allows current flow in one direction
- Transistor: Takes in a small electrical current at its BASE PIN and amplifies it such that a much larger current can pass between its collector and emitter pins.

## Sources in ECA

- What is source?
- Source is a device that converts Mechanical, Chemical, Thermal or some other form of energy into Electrical Energy.

## Two types of Sources in ECA
- [[Voltage Source]]: has a forcing function of EMF
 1. Ideal Voltage Source
 2. Practical Voltage Source
- [[Current Source]]: has a forcing function of current
1. Ideal
2. Practical

#                   Resistance

The Opposition to the flow of charge through an electrical circuit is called The Resistance. Uni: Ohm

Due primarily to "Collisions and friction between free electrons and other electrons, ions and atoms" in the path of motion converts the supplied electricity into heat that raises the temperature
