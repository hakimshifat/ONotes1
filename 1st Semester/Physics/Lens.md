Defination : Any transparent medium bounded by two spherical surfaces or one spherical AND one plane surface or two cylindrical surface or one cylindrical and one plane surface is called a lens.

What can be lens made of:
1. Transparent Material
2. Glass
3. Plastic
# Used to 'focus' or 'disperse light.'

Use:
1. Eye Glass
2. Cameras
3. Telescopes

# Types of Lens

1.Convex Lens: Used to focus lens.

2. Concave Lens: Used to disperse light

## Definations
1. Center of curvature: Each surface of lens is a part of a sphere. So a lens has two center of curvature on its two side. And the Center of those two curvature is called the center of curvature of the surface.

2.Radius of curvature: A lens have two radius of curvature. See image below

3. Principle Focus:  A lens have two principle Focus.
	1. First Principle or Primary Principle: It is that point of principle axis at which if an object is placed from 'finite' distance, the image would form at infinity [[Principle focus.excalidraw]]
	4. Second Principle or Secondary Principle: it is that point where the image is formed WHEN THE OBJECT IS AT INFINTY and image would form at finite distance
	
	3.Focus Length: It is a property of lens or mirrors that determines how strongly a lens or a mirror would converge or diverge light. It is basically the distance between optical center and Principle focus. [[Focal length.excalidraw]]
	
	4.Nodal Points and Nodal planes:

	##  What is nodes?
	If the medium on One side of the lens is DIFFERENT from other side of the lens,
	there becomes "A PAIR OF CONJUGATE POINT" so that if rays be allowed to pass through the first point N1(say) then its corresponding point will be parallel to the first ray(incident ray) and will appear to DIVERGE from or pass through the second point N2

	So in the picture, N1 and N2 are called first and second Nodal point.

	# What is Nodal Planes
	Nodal planes are one kind of planes that are drawn perpendicular to the principle axis of the lens and they pass through the nodal points.
## Deviation Produced by a Lens
- A monochromatic light is parallal to the principle axis be the incident on a thin lens at a height h above the axis and let f be the focal length of the lens.
- [[Deviation by LensDrawing 2023-08-24 17.01.29.excalidraw]]

tha(theta)=h/f
if theta is small enough
tan(theta)=theta

so finally we get

(Theta)=h/f
## Equivalent Lens

An equivalent lens is a lens that has the same optical properties as another lens but with different FOCAL LENGTH

Two lens can be considered equivalent if they produce the same angle of view and same depth of field regardless of the actual focal length of the lens.
