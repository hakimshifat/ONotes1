Defination : Any transparent medium bounded by two spherical surfaces or one spherical AND one plane surface or two cylindrical surface or one cylindrical and one plane surface is called a lens.

What can be lens made of:
1. Transparent Matrial
2. Glass
3. Plastic
# Used to focus or disperse light.

Use:
1. EyeGlass
2. Cameras
3. Telescopes

# Types of Lens

1.Convex Lens: Used to focus lens.

2. Concave Lens: Used to disperse light

## Definations
1. Center of curvature: Each surface of lens is a part of a sphere. So a lens has two center of curvature on its two side. And the Center of those two curvature is called the center of curvature of the surface.

2.Radius of curvature: A lens have two radius of curvature. See image below

3. Principle Focus:  A lens have two principle Focus.
	1. First Principle or Primary Principle: It is that point of principle axis at which if an object is placed from 'finite' distance, the image would form at infinity [[Principle focus.excalidraw]]
	4. Second Principle or Secondary Principle: it is that point where the image is formed WHEN THE OBJECT IS AT INFINTY and image would form at finite distance
	
	3.Focus Length: It is a property of lens or mirrors that determines how strongly a lens or a mirror would converge or diverge light. It is basically the distance between optical center and Principle focus. [[Focal length.excalidraw]]
