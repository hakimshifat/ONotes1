## Electrical Network

- Passive Elements : The elements which receives or absorbs energy and either converts it into heat or store it in an magnetic field 
  - Ex: Transformer
- Active Elements: Only supplies energy
  - Ex: Transistor



- Bilateral Elements: Conduction in BOTH DIRECTION.Ex: Inductor, Capacitor
- Unilateral: Allows coduction in  Only One direction. Ex: Diode, Transistor


- What is response: An application of input signal to the system that will produce an output signal, the behavior of output signal with time is known as the response of the system.

# Electrical Signal

- AC: The directing electricity flows throughout the circuit is CONSTANTLY REVERSING.
- DC: Electricity flows in one direction between power and ground.
