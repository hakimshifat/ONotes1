# What is proton:
The nucleus of the hydrogen atom is the proton, a positively charged particle.
[[Atomic Structure]]

## Electrical Network

- Passive Elements : The elements which receives or absorbs energy and either converts it into heat or store it in an magnetic field 
  - Ex: Transformer
- Active Elements: Only supplies energy
  - Ex: Transistor



- Bilateral Elements: Conduction in BOTH DIRECTION.Ex: Inductor, Capacitor
- Unilateral: Allows coduction in  Only One direction. Ex: Diode, Transistor


- What is response: An application of input signal to the system that will produce an output signal, the behavior of output signal with time is known as the response of the system.

# Electrical Signal

- AC: The directing electricity flows throughout the circuit is CONSTANTLY REVERSING.
- DC: Electricity flows in one direction between power and ground. There is always a positive source of voltage and ground source(0V) of voltage


## Electrical Componants
- Capacitor: stores electricity and then discharges it into the circuit when there is a drop in electricity
- Diode: Allows current flow in one direction
- Transistor: Takes in a small electrical current at its BASE PIN and amplifies it such that a much larger current can pass between its colle
