- Bangladesh - Geography. This part of the document introduces the course on Bangladesh’s geography and its location, area, boundary, physiography, river system, forest and climate.
- Location and Boundary. Bangladesh is located in the eastern part of Bengal, bordered by India, Myanmar and the Bay of Bengal. The tropic of cancer passes through the country. The total land area is 147,570 sq km and the total land border is 4,413 km.
- Physiography and River System. Bangladesh has a low-lying deltaic plain with a small hilly region in the southeast and northeast. The plain is criss-crossed by many rivers, which can be divided into four major networks: the Jamuna-Brahmaputra, the Padma-Ganges, the Surma-Meghna and the Padma-Meghna. The Karnaphuli is the main river in the Chittagong region.
- Climate and Forests. Bangladesh has a tropical monsoon climate with wide seasonal variations in rainfall, temperature and humidity. There are six traditional seasons in Bangladesh: summer, rainy, autumn, late autumn, winter and spring. The country has four major types of forests: hill forests, saal forests, mangrove forests and mangrove plantations. There are also freshwater swamp forests and homestead forests.
- Demography and Geo-Strategic Implications. Bangladesh has a population of about 170 million, of which 98% are ethnic Bengalis and 91% are Muslims. There are also small ethnic groups and Biharis in different regions. Bangladesh’s geo-strategic location has both advantages and disadvantages. It facilitates rainfall, land fertility, maritime connections and trade, but also makes it prone to natural disasters, flooding, erosion and salinity.

# Suggested Question:

### What are the geostatistic implecation of location of Bangladesh?

- **Rainfall and sediment supply**: Bangladesh’s proximity to the Himalayas facilitates favorable conditions for rainfall and also supplies huge amounts of sediments through the GBM river system. This enhances the land fertility and agricultural productivity of the country.
- **Sunshine**: Bangladesh’s location on the Tropic of Cancer ensures sufficient sunshine throughout the year, which is beneficial for the growth of crops and the generation of solar energy.
- **Maritime connections**: Bangladesh’s easy maritime connections provide her extra importance in world affairs and trade. Bangladesh has access to the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean, which are strategic waterways for regional and global commerce and security.
- **Natural disasters**: Bangladesh’s location also makes her prone to natural disasters like cyclones, floods, river bank erosion, and salinity. These hazards pose serious threats to the lives and livelihoods of the people, as well as the infrastructure and environment of the country.



1. **Proximity to Himalayas:**
    
    - Facilitates favorable conditions for maintaining sufficient rainfall.
    - Receives a significant amount of sediments through the GBM (Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna) river system.
2. **Tropic of Cancer:**
    
    - Passes almost through the center of Bangladesh.
    - Being located in the sub-tropical region, the country receives enough sunshine throughout the year (2800 hours).
3. **Maritime Connections:**
    
    - Easy maritime connections provide Bangladesh with extra importance in world affairs.
    - Offers additional advantages in terms of export and import activities.
4. **Location in the Indo-Gangetic Plain:**
    
    - The country is situated in the Indo-Gangetic plain, providing high levels of land fertility and high productivity in agriculture.
5. **Geo-Strategic Vulnerabilities:**
    
    - However, the geo-strategic location also makes Bangladesh prone to natural disasters:
        - Cyclones
        - Floods
        - River bank erosion
        - Salinity

In summary, while Bangladesh's location offers several advantages, such as access to waterways and fertile land, it also poses challenges due to its susceptibility to various natural disasters, which are inherent in its geographical setting.




1. Its proximity to the Himalayas facilitates enough rainfall and also supplies a large amount of sediments through the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) river system.
2. The Tropic of Cancer passing through Bangladesh means the country, being located in the sub-tropical region, receives abundant sunshine throughout the year (approximately 2800 hours).
3. Easy maritime connections give Bangladesh extra significance in world affairs and provide added advantage for its export and import activities.
4. Being located in the Indo-Gangetic plain provides Bangladesh with high fertility of land and high productivity in agriculture.
5. However, the geo-strategic location also makes Bangladesh prone to natural disasters such as cyclones, floods, river bank erosion, and salinity.
