# Main Topic : [[Chemical Bonding]]


What is chemical bonding: A force that acts between two or more atoms to hold them together as a stable molecule.
1. [[Ionic or Electrovalent Bond]]
2. [[Covalent Bond]]
3. [[Coordinate Covalent Bond]]
4. Metallic Bond

# Lewis Dot Symbols:

It consists of the symbol of an element and one dot for each valence electron in an atom of the element.

Number of Unpaired dots corresponds to the number of bonds an atom of the element can form in a compound.


## Steps:
1. Calculate the total number of valence electron for the molecule by summing the number of valence electrons for each atoms. (Anion number will be added)
2. Write the skeleton structure and connecting every bonded pair by a pair of dots or dash(Each bond will consume two electrons)
3. Distribute electrons to the atoms surrounding the central atom satisfying the octet rule
4. IF ANY ELECTRON PAIR REMAIN---- distribute to the central atom.
	1. If there are fewer then 8 electrons on central atom, that suggests multiple bond.(Like say there are two electrons in the central atom. Two is less then 8. So it can be assumed that there are a double bond present)
## Geometries of Molecules

Molecules containing 3 or >3 atoms are 3D or 3 Dimentional
